                    <p>The latitude analysis was initiated by pulling 1,500 random latitude and longitude coordinates using Numpy.  
                        Python Citipy library was then used to obtain the closest cities to the random coordinates. Of the 1,500 coordinates,
                        only a little more than 600 cities were identified.
                        
                        Using OpenWeatherMap API, data on temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed was captured for each of the 
                        cities.  Scatter plots were created to compare city latitudes with each of the temperature, humidity, cloudiness and
                        wind speed data points.  Analysis showed that latitude has a strong correlation with temperature, but humidity,
                        cloudiness and wind speed do not correlate with latitude.
